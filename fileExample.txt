1. People are not born heroes or villains; they’re created 
by the people around them.
― Chris Colfer

2. The Darkling just stared out into the waves. I considered 
shoving him over the railing. Sure, he was hundreds of years old, 
but could he swim?
― Leigh Bardugo, Siege and Storm

3. You learn eventually that, while there are no villains, 
there are no heroes either. And until you make the final 
discovery that there are only human beings, who are therefore 
all the more fascinating, you are liable to miss something.
― Paul Gallico
